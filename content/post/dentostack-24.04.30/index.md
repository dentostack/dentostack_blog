At Dentostack, we are thrilled to announce the release of Dentostack 24.04.30, our latest and most advanced version yet, launched on April 30, 2024. This milestone release embodies our commitment to innovation and excellence, offering a suite of powerful features designed to elevate dental practice management to new heights.

# Streamlined Invoice Entry with Customizable Dates

In our continuous quest to enhance user experience, we recognize the importance of flexibility and efficiency in everyday workflows. In previous versions of Dentostack, users encountered challenges when inputting transaction dates, often necessitating additional editing steps post-entry.

To address this, Dentostack 24.04.30 introduces a seamless solution. Now, when adding a new transaction, users have the freedom to select the desired date directly, eliminating the need for subsequent edits. This streamlined approach not only saves time but also ensures accuracy and ease of use. With the date field pre-filled with today's date, users can effortlessly manage transactions with unparalleled convenience.

# Enhanced Appointment Notifications with WhatsApp Integration

Communication lies at the heart of patient care, and at Dentostack, we understand the significance of effective appointment notifications. While SMS has long been the standard channel for such notifications, the evolving landscape of messaging apps demands greater versatility.

With Dentostack 24.04.30, we are proud to introduce seamless WhatsApp integration for appointment notifications. Now, dental practices can leverage the power of WhatsApp to deliver confirmations, reminders, and cancellations directly to patients, enhancing communication and engagement. By enabling WhatsApp notifications through the Admin Panel, practices can embrace modern communication channels while maintaining reliability and efficiency.

# Simplified Appointment Booking with Direct Patient List Access

Efficiency is the cornerstone of successful dental practice management, and Dentostack 24.04.30 embodies this principle with a feature designed to streamline appointment booking. In previous versions, navigating through multiple screens to book appointments posed challenges for users, leading to potential delays and errors.

## Improved User Settings for a Better Experience

At Dentostack, we’re always looking for ways to make your experience simpler and more enjoyable. With feedback from our users, we have redesigned the User Settings interface to bring a cleaner, more user-friendly experience.

Our updated User Settings layout makes navigation straightforward, helping you quickly find and adjust the settings you need without any hassle.

## Updated for TRAI Compliance

To align with the latest TRAI guidelines, we’ve updated our system to ensure that all URLs shared over SMS are properly whitelisted. According to the press release "TRAI Mandates Whitelisted URLs, APKS, or OTT links for SMS Traffic" (26/09/2024), it is essential to follow these new regulations to maintain compliance.

For dynamically generated links—such as those for prescriptions, case summaries, and invoices—we've adopted the required format to meet TRAI compliance standards. These adjustments ensure complete compliance while maintaining smooth and uninterrupted functionality for our users.
